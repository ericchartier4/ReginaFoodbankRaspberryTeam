FoodBank Team Raspberry HiFi Interactivity Notes
------------------------------------------------
1. The Pick a Hamper Dietary Restrictions pages have limited interactivity. Only one restriction can be selected at a time. For example: if you select Diabetic and then decide you want a different restriction, Diabetic must be unselected first to select the other restriction.  
Example flow: {Tell Us your Restrictions for your Food Hamper -> Diabetic -> Diabetic -> Gluten Free -> Gluten Free -> Choose the method to get your Food Hamper}.

2. The Retrieval Method pages also have limited interactivity. The month can only be changed on the Method PickUp - 18 artboard; you can only go forward and backward to February, March, and April.
Example flow: {Method PickUp - 18 -> next month -> previous month -> previous month -> next month}

3. On artboard Method PickUp - 18, there is some interactivity to test out the date and time selectors. You can select the 10th and change the time to 12:30 pm, or you can change the method to delivery and then change the date to the 14th and also change the time.
Example flow 1: {Method PickUp - 18 -> change method to delivery -> select the 14th -> 12:00pm -> 12:30pm -> 1:00pm -> 12:30pm}
Example flow 2: {Method PickUp - 18 -> select the 10th -> 12:00pm -> 11:00am -> 1:00pm -> 11:00am}
